# Git Lab – Learning Summary

## Overview
This repository contains hands-on Git lab programs completed as part of learning **Version Control Systems using Git**.  
Through these programs, I learned how to manage source code, collaborate using remote repositories, and analyze Git history.
## What I Have Learned
### 1. Git Basics
- Initializing a Git repository using `git init`
- Checking repository status using `git status`
- Adding files to the staging area using `git add`
- Committing changes with meaningful messages using `git commit`
### 2. Working with Branches
- Creating new branches using `git branch`
- Switching between branches using `git checkout`
- Merging branches using `git merge`
- Handling merge conflicts and committing merged changes
### 3. Stashing Changes
- Temporarily saving uncommitted changes using `git stash`
- Switching branches safely without committing
- Applying stashed changes using `git stash apply`
- Applying and removing stash using `git stash pop`
- Managing multiple stashes using `stash@{}`
### 4. Collaboration Using Remote Repositories
- Cloning a remote repository using `git clone`
- Fetching latest changes using `git fetch`
- Rebasing local branch with remote branch using `git rebase`
- Continuing or aborting rebase during conflicts
- Pushing changes to remote repository using `git push`
### 5. Advanced Git Operations
- Creating and pushing lightweight tags using `git tag`
- Cherry-picking specific commits between branches using `git cherry-pick`
- Handling cherry-pick conflicts
### 6. Analyzing Git History
- Viewing commit history using `git log`
- Displaying commit details using `git show`
- Filtering commits by author and date
- Displaying recent commits in compact format
- Resetting repository to a previous commit using `git reset`
## Tools Used
- Git Bash
- GitHub (Remote Repository)
## Conclusion
Through these lab programs, I gained practical knowledge of Git commands used for version control, collaboration, and project management.  
This helped me understand real-world Git workflows such as branching, merging, rebasing, and history management.
